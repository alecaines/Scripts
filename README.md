# What have I stumbled upon here?

This repository holds code that I have made to make my life a bit more easier.
I hope to create a wiki some time in the future containing execution instructions
and descriptions for each of the files. However, until that happens, I will 
entail descriptions and execution instructions below.

## Aggregate
### Description
aggregate.py collects multiple files that occur with the same name and different filetypes
and puts them into a relevant directory. I made this file because my version of vim creates
auxiliary files when editing the document of interest and it clutters my working directory.
This program aims at decluttering the working directory.
### Execution instructions
If you have python installed on your machine, then run  
```python
python3 aggregate.py
```
